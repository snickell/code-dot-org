# Skaffold still doesn't have native builder support for `docker buildx`, which is
# essential both for getting multi-platform builds AND perhaps more importantly
# for being able to use a registry cache (or even inline cache), especially with
# multiple source images that layer together.
#
# Without this, every build is from scratch and is slow, because our GitHub actions
# builder doesn't maintain a local docker cache between builds.
#
# I've tested trying to hack some degree of layer caching in without using a custom
# build command using BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1, but it only works when we replace
# `docker build` with `docker buildx`, and then it breaks skaffold on cache hits
# because nothing loads them back into the daemon for the next build stage, and there's
# no way to pass --push on to them (skaffold doesn't).
#
# So as ugly as this is, using a custom build command with skaffold is still the
# only real way to get layer caching + multi-stage builds, until skaffold supports
# `docker buildx` (NOT buildkit, that's not enough) natively.
#
# If you want to experiment with new builders or configuration, its recommended to
# try it out on the "toy" docker setup first, which builds fast but exhibits the
# necessary multi-stage and layer complexity, easy to double-check caching behavior:
