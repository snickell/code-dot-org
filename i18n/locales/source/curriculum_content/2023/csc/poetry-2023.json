      "overview": "In this CS and ELA integrated lesson for new coders, students will animate a poem with code to illustrate the mood of a poem. First, students will read and detect the mood of a famous poem. Then, they will then find corresponding effects and images to help illustrate the poem's mood. Finally, students will use events (code) to illustrate a shift in mood or animate new images in a poem.",
      "preparation": "-   Play through the levels and review the lesson slides \n-   Decide on pacing between student work time and whole group instruction.\n-   Consider exploring the recommended preparation activities before beginning ([link][0]).\n-   Consider these related extension options ([link][1]) to explore after the last lesson.\n\n##### Optional:\n\n-   [Optional] Review this **[teacher’s guide to debugging][2]** to be prepared to help students find and fix errors in their code. \n-   [Optional] **Pair Programming** - Decide if you want students to engage in pair programming. Watch this [video][3] and visit this [Support][4] page for more information.",
      "purpose": "The purpose of this lesson is to teach students how to create poem art by using code to animate the mood of a poem. This provides an engaging and interactive learning experience that integrates language arts and computer science. By combining poetry analysis with coding, the lesson aims to help students develop a deeper understanding of the emotional impact of language and to express this impact through visual art.",

Encourage students to share their interpretation, even if it’s different from someone else’s. Make sure that all students are familiar with the structure of a poem before Lesson 2, in which students will write their own poems.\n\n**Computer Science:**  As a warm up to the tool students can add art and animation to a classic poem in this [Poem Art][0] (55 minutes) Hour of Code activity!\n\nAdditionally, in this module students will use event blocks to program changes at important lines in the poem. To start building skills with events try [Build a Flappy Game][1] (60 minutes) . "

                "#### General Support\n\nBy the end of this activity, students will have an animated poem that represents their visual interpretation of the poem they chose. This lesson is designed to give students an opportunity to tinker with their code and find the visual effects that they like best. \n\nWhile circling the room, encourage students to:\n\n-   **Take Your Time:** Most of the levels require students to find the perfect effects to match their interpretation of the mood of the poem. Staying on a level and tinkering with their code is highly encouraged. \n\n-   **Find a poem you like:** The poem that displays for a student at a new level is just a suggestion. There is a poem dropdown menu with pre-loaded poems at the top of the playspace. Ask students to read through a few and find one that speaks to them. They can then start animating the poem they chose with code. \n\n-   **Show off a completed level:** Any level bubble that is fully green means the student successfully completed all the requirements for that level. Ask a student to click on a green bubble to show off what they created. \n\nFor the times when a student feels stuck: \n\n-   **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n    -   <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n-   <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n-   **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "

This helps them understand the expectations and work towards meeting the outlined criteria. Additionally, as you grade their work, refer to the rubric consistently, so that each aspect of the project is assessed based on the same set of standards.

Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using pair programming.\n-   **Read the Instructions:** The instructions are bulleted points on how to complete the level. If a student feels stuck, ask them to read the instructions out loud to you and ask them to repeat back what the instructions say in their own words. \n    -   <img src=\"https://images.code.org/5b99c663ad6632fe64c9da69d6805c2b-text-to-speech.PNG\" style=\"height: 25px;\"> Students can also click on this text-to-speech icon to hear the instructions read aloud.\n-   <img src=\"https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png\" style=\"height: 35px;\"> **Look for hints**: Most levels include at least one hint with more explicit details about how to pass the level. \n-   **Celebrate bugs:** Getting a bug in your code is a natural part of the coding process. If the program isn’t doing what they expected, ask the student to first tell you what they want to happen, click run to observe what is actually happening, then find the place in their code that caused the discrepancy. Remember to celebrate finding bugs and fixing bugs. Getting a bug means students are doing a great job building a more complex program. "
