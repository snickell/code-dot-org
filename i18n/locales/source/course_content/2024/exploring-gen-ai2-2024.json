Let's experiment and see what questions we can get answered.\n\n**Fair Warning:** This chatbot is for educational purposes, so we've built in appropriate restrictions and accountability to make sure it doesn't get abused. Inappropriate messages from you _or_ the chatbot will be flagged and not displayed. The chatbot also keeps track of **all messages you send to it**, and your teacher can view these messages (even the ones that were flagged as inappropriate). So be sure to just use the chatbot as directed!\n\n### Do This\n\n1.  Ask the chatbot 3-4 questions. Try to determine its purpose.\n2.  Find the button that lets you clear the chat. This also resets the conversation\n3.  Find the button that lets you copy the chat. This will be useful to know about later!\n\nTest the chatbot!

For example, the 👋 and 👍 emojis can mean different things in different cultures - and sometimes they mean something offensive! <a href=\"https://pumble.com/blog/culture-emoji/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more here</a>.\r\n\r\nMariah wants to use a chatbot to help make sure she has the right cultural norms and etiquette when visiting another country.\r\n\r\n### Do This\r\n\r\nSearch for information about the cultural do's and don'ts when visiting China to use as sources for the chatbot. For example: you may find details on international consulate websites or travel blogs. Then design a chatbot that offers advice on interacting with people while in China to not offend anyone or embarrass yourself.\r\n\r\n**A Note About Testing:** When testing the chatbot, don't ask questions like \"How do Chinese people do [X]\" - this is likely to generate biased stereotypes based on how language models are trained. Instead, ask questions like \"When in China, what is the proper way to [X]\" or \"What are things for tourists to avoid when doing [X] in China\".\r\n\r\n**Alternative Task:** Instead of making this chatbot specific to visiting China, you can substitute another country like Egypt, Ghana, India, or the US."

My job involves spreading awareness about environmental issues and coordinating community involvement in our local initiatives. It's all about communication—crafting messages that resonate with people and organizing events that bring our community together for a good cause.\n\n### Why I'm Here\n\nI'm leading a project to get more people involved in our local cleanup efforts. Litter is a big issue in our city, ruining the look of our public spaces and harming our environment. I think using technology could really help make our cleanup events more fun and easy to join, especially if people can use it to find upcoming events. A chatbot could be a real game-changer, giving us a direct way to teach people about the bad effects of litter and empowering them to do something about it. By using this chatbot in our campaigns, I want to change the way our community gets involved with our environmental programs, making it simpler and more interesting for everyone to help make our city healthier and more sustainable.\n\n**Defining the Problem:** There is low community engagement in environmental initiatives, and people are not well-informed about the negative impacts of littering.\n\n> We've been asked to help develop a chatbot for this person. Before diving in, let's take a moment to **Prepare** and plan how we can develop this chatbot\n>\n> 1.  How could we use a **System Prompt** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is a System Prompt most helpful for?\n> 2.  How could we use **Retrieval** when making the chatbot? What parts of this problem is Retrieval most helpful for?"

My role involves organizing activities and managing services that cater to the needs of elderly members of our community. I work to create a welcoming and supportive environment that helps reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation among our seniors.\n\n### Why I'm Here\n\nMany of our elderly members are not just physically isolated but also digitally disconnected, which can intensify feelings of exclusion. I see a great opportunity to use a chatbot to bridge this gap. By developing a chatbot that can start friendly chats, remind them of upcoming events, and offer easy-to-understand tech support, we can make our members feel more connected and integrated into the community. This chatbot could act like a virtual companion, helping them navigate both the social and technological aspects of their lives more confidently. This aligns perfectly with my goal to improve our elderly members' engagement and well-being.\n\n**Defining the Problem:** Elderly community members feel isolated and struggle with using modern technology, affecting their social engagement and access to community resources.\n\n> We've been asked to help develop a chatbot for this person.

I create marketing materials, manage social media content, and help organize events that can draw visitors.\n\n### Why I'm Here\n\nThinking about boosting tourism post-pandemic, I believe a chatbot could really help personalize the way we interact with potential tourists. By providing tailored travel suggestions, fun historical facts, and updates on current events, a chatbot can make planning their visit easier and more exciting. This tool could be a key part of our strategy to enhance tourists' experiences, making them feel uniquely cared for and informed. This way, they're more likely to enjoy longer stays and participate in more activities, which is exactly what we need to boost our local tourism industry.\n\n**Defining the Problem:** The local tourism industry needs revitalization post-pandemic, with a need to attract tourists through personalized and engaging information.\n\n> We've been asked to help develop a chatbot for this person.
