If you have your own system for tracking vocabulary that you've used in previous units, consider applying it here as well so students have a consistent experience.\n\nIf you don't have a system for managing vocabulary, you might consider the following strategies:\n- Create a Word Wall or posters for these vocabulary terms and hang them up in your classroom as they are introduced throughout the unit. \n- Provide a vocabulary handout that is updated after lessons and lives near desks or computers so students can reference as needed."

        "description": "Let students know they will likely change their minds as the discussion continues and that’s okay, and allowing students to state their confidence level for their initial thoughts can make them more comfortable speaking up since it feels less “high-stakes”. Be prepared to address the following situations in this discussion:\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />3) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya\">cherimoya</a> is a fruit common to South America, but may not be a common fruit your students have heard of. It’s possible many students may say “this isn’t a word”, but one or two students may speak up because they’re familiar with this fruit. Be sure to elevate those voices and highlight how our own knowledge is sometimes limited by lack of exposure to different words or phrases. Or, if no one raises this point, be sure to point this out to students explicitly such as showing them the Wikipedia page. In either case, make sure cherimoya is classified as a “word” before leaving the discussion\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />8) ullaakkut and 10) yá'át'ééh are both words in other languages - <a href=\"https://www.adventurecanada.com/canadian-high-arctic-and-greenland/ullaakkut-a-guide-to-inuktitut-for-beginners\">ullaakkut means hello in Inuktitut</a>, a language spoken by Inuit peoples in Canada and Greenland; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h0tbtlZx0A\">yá'át'ééh means “hello” in the Navajo / Diné language</a>. Similar to above, students may initially classify these as not words because they are unfamiliar with them, but it is important to surface the meaning and use of these words to students either with a quick google search or elevating the voice of a student in class who is already familiar with these words. As a result, make sure these terms don’t end up in the “Not Words” category by the end of the discussion.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />4) wierd is a misspelling of either the word “weird” or the word “wired”. Students may initially say that this is “not a word”, but another student or yourself should challenge them by pointing out that if this is typed into a device with autocorrect, it will automatically correct it to one of these other words. Even in this slide deck, the word has a red squiggly underline representing that the computer recognizes it as something, even if it’s not a correctly spelled word. This may inspire the class to create a new category to represent this term - it’s not a correctly spelled word, but it’s also not a made-up word, so maybe there’s a new category for “misspelled words” or “important terms that aren’t words”. Let students guide how they want to handle this situation, even if they decide not to make a new category and it remains in “not word”.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />At some point, students who are more familiar with the Scrabble game may try to invoke the “rules of Scrabble” which restrict words in other languages, proper nouns, or abbreviations. From this perspective, words (8) and (10) above would be restricted, as would 5) Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) and 9) ATM (since it is an abbreviation for Automatic Teller Machine). If this comes up, use this as an opportunity to question the effect that arbitrary rules have on what we consider valid language, since these are all definitely words that are used in society even if not officially allowed in Scrabble. You could consider creating new categories to represent these phrases, such as “Still words but not allowed in Scrabble” or “Part of language, but not allowed in Scrabble”. Or, the class could decide these belong in the Words category, regardless of what Scrabble thinks, and that’s the end of the story.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> Ultimately, this is an exercise to surface that the way we identify words versus nonsense - much like Calvin and Hobbes in the comic panel - can be contextual to our lived experiences and influences what we consider important information versus random noise that can be ignored. It’s okay if the discussion ends without closure, so long as students have wrestled with how what they initially considered “words” may have been expanded as they were exposed to new contexts in the discussion. However, be very intentional that the discussion ends with very few items in the “Not Words” category, especially making sure ullaakkut and yá'át'ééh are not in this category and are instead classified as either a Word or a new category the class has created."

Students may pick up on this and ask what the models really “know” or “understand” at this point, or you may hear students saying the model “knows what this word means” which isn’t quite correct. At this stage, all we’re doing is building a “word bank” that a model can recognize and eventually reproduce. But the model doesn’t have any inherent understanding of the meaning of these words - this happens in later steps and later lessons. If we asked a model to respond to a prompt just with the training done today, it could generate any of the words students are putting on their posters, but the results would be random and nonsensical since it doesn’t have any tools to help it make decisions about which words are best used in which situations. Nevertheless, this is a necessary step in understanding how a language model works - a model can’t even begin to “understand” a word if it’s not even included in it’s training data."

Specifically, try to list the following for each article:\n\t\t<br />- The first name of the author\n\t\t<br />- The year it was written\n\t\t<br />- The type of food it focuses on (ie: American, Indian, Mexican, etc. Or, focus on: fast-food, home-cooking, fine-dining, etc)\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Discussion Goal:</strong> At first, students are only sharing out their articles. However, as you listen to student responses, be looking for patterns and potential biases in the data that's been collected.

For example, none of the articles seem to address a specific cuisine (ie: there are no articles yet with Korean food).\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />Once you've identified at least one of these patterns, pause and ask the whole class to raise their hand if their articles also followed this pattern. For example: \"I'm noticing most of these articles are written within the last 10 years. Can you raise your hand if your article was also written in the last 10 years?\", or \"I'm noticing none of these articles are about food from the Middle East.

The most likely example to occur in this lesson is a recency bias (where most of the articles are only a few years old), but this activity also lends itself to noticing gender bias (where all the authors are the same gender) and a cultural bias (where certain cultural foods are emphasized while others are excluded). In an ideal world, one of these patterns emerges quickly as students share their responses and you can move on to the next slide in a timely manner. However, it is possible that no clear biased pattern emerges even after calling on 6-8 students. In this case, it may be helpful to continue to the next slide anyway and discuss bias, but then ask the class to imagine ways bias could have manifested in this activity. This is less impactful than when students notice these patterns themselves, but cueing students this way still lets you continue with the lesson in a timely manner."

When the page loads, it provides a visualization of several words mapped onto a 3D space. They have a <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/WordEmbeddingDemo/tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial available</a> that explains more about how this works. This can be an option to show students if they are interested, but graphing words on 2D or 3D spaces is not something students are expected to do in this course so we have avoided it in the lesson and instead present it as an option."

Just because we could answer some very direct questions about the text, does that mean we truly “understand” it? Digging into this may reveal that regurgitating responses from the text doesn’t always mean we know what we’re talking about. You can also relate this to student experiences where they may have earned a high-score on a test, but never really feel like they “learned” the material - a similar phenomenon has happened in the warm up.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br /><i class=\"fa fa-microphone\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Say:</strong> Even without really understanding any of the words in this paragraph, we were able to figure out how to use the words from context and answer some questions.

This unit makes a decision to simplify what is presented to students, focusing on weights and hidden layers as the key things to understand in this introduction to neural networks. As students take additional courses or progress their understanding of artificial intelligence, they will likely learn more advanced components of these networks such as bias parameters and activation functions and the mathematics required to activate the network - these details are abstracted in this curriculum, but could be explored in other lessons. If you are interested in a deeper technical dive into neural networks for your own curiosity, we recommend the video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\" target=\"_blank\">But what is a neural network?</a> from the threeblueonebrown Youtube channel.

Some students may think the consequences - a life-threatening reaction - may necessitate removing this risk from the system altogether. Others may think that, since this is something where personal judgement can be applied by just a subset of users, it may be fine to let this network keep designing meals with peanuts. Focus the conversation on wrestling with both sides of the debate, elevating student voices to think critically and carefully about the scenario.

Some kitchens avoid nuts altogether so consumers can be sure they won’t have an allergic reaction.

Consider pausing the lesson here and have students reflect on their own experiences or knowledge with AI or other technologies where they witnessed unintended impacts. One example could be the [Twitter Cropping Algorithm](https://blog.x.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/sharing-learnings-about-our-image-cropping-algorithm), which was discovered to make biased decisions on what it decided to crop out of photos. This blog post is a great example of an organization taking action once the unintended harm was discovered, although it is likely too technical for students to read and process on their own."

        "description": "**For the Teacher:** In this game, you know the secret rules (explained below) and are reacting to the suggestions that the class makes. As the class suggests words, you tell them whether or not words are accepted or rejected. This game requires students to notice patterns in the words that are accepted or rejected, and use those patterns to inform the guesses they make. The goal of the activity is for students to eventually discern the rules of the game from these patterns.\n\n**The Rules:** The secret of the game is: words with double letters are accepted and all others are rejected. This is why Teeth is accepted (because of the double e’s) while Mouth is not (because no letter is repeated). This is also where the name of the game comes from - Green Glass Door all have double letters.\n\n**Playing the Game:** Ask students to suggest words and write them down somewhere visible, then tell the class whether the Green Glass Door accepts or rejects each word. Instead of doing this one-at-a-time, it can be helpful to take words in batches - like 3 to 5 at a time - and then mark each one as accept or reject in a batch. It’s important to leave all guesses in a visible spot so students can look at the data to inform their next guesses. Over time, students may start to notice the pattern - that words with double-letters are accepted - and start guessing those more frequently. If students are struggling to catch on, it can be helpful to rewrite the list so several accepted words are together and several rejected words are together. You can also provide your own examples, or reference the name of game - Green Glass Door - as a hint.\n\n**Managing Expectations:** This activity has a specific type of engagement that some students may struggle with: the activity deliberately starts with 0 knowledge, so most answers are likely to be incorrect rather than correct. Some students may struggle with randomly guessing and getting it incorrect more often in the beginning. However, this is exactly the mindset that is necessary to carry forward into the rest of the lesson and is an important part of how machine learning really works: machines make an enormous amount of incorrect guesses that are gradually refined over time before eventually getting more and more accurate.\n\n**Ending the Game:** As the game continues, some students will discovered the rule while others may not. Encourage the students who think they know to keep it a secret until others have caught on. Using your judgement, when enough students feel like they know the rule, continue to the next slide to reveal the rule of the game",

It can be very easy for this to slip into the realm of “favorites” or “preferences”, where groups might argue one word is better than others for a variety of reasons. Ideally, the structure of this lesson steers away from these conversations by leaving that choice up to mathematics and probability - we aren’t making any kind of “value judgement” on the words, but instead comparing them to the data and seeing how frequently those words appeared in the data we collected. Hopefully this helps ground this decision away from ideas of “favorite” or “best”, and more towards “most probable from the data”. However, the underlying point - that there is some kind of preference or favoritism happening - is still fair, but the real place to have that conversation is when collecting the initial data used in the app. If students want the app to make different choices, they should collect more data and see how it influences the app."

This leads to a discussion of why the language model would choose Pluto as its answer, when this is no longer true. From last class, students should recall that language models use probability to choose the words they generate. And since Pluto was the smallest planet for hundreds of years, most articles used to train a language model probably included this fact.
