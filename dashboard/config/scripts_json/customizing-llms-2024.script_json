Students take on a persona of someone impacted by generative AI to read a few articles and react in-character. Then, students form groups and are given a scenario involving their persona and generative AI. Working together, they come up with guidelines for how generative AI should be implemented in this scenario that includes the voices and perspectives of all stakeholders. Finally, students share their results with the class and reflect on this process.",

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about \"right or wrong\" answers. For more information about these levels, please read the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wESWwYm7Ty46eEK9qFcYfYI7NfG9mqodD12YOmuUcrs/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Teaching Guide to Incorporating Student Responses in Lessons</a>."

Some students may use this as an opportunity to make some interesting observations, such as:\n\t\t<br />- There are two sections to the prompt.

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

This can help us understand how the sentence “The food in Tucson is awesome - some great restaurants in Tucson are Poco and Moms, Kingfisher, and Franks.” impacts our model.\n- In the initial training data, a word like “Franks” was probably “close” to an entirely different set of words. For example: it could be “close” to “hot dog” or “person” or “blunt” because of the phrase “Let me be frank with you…”\n- This sentence creates a new association between “Franks” and the phrase “great restaurant”, along with other great restaurants like Kingfisher and Poco and Moms.\n- This helps update the embedding for “Franks” so it is now “closer” to other great restaurants, and more likely to be listed in a chatbot response.\n\nIf students need a refresher on embeddings, consider showing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1fhxAVpYx8\" target=\"_blank\">Generative AI: Storage & Embeddings video</a>"

This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase. For that reason, try to encourage students to put their energy into finding quality sources (like websites or books) to copy from, since this is the more realistic behavior of language models outside of this lab."

This is very loosely inspired by real-world events where school districts relied on chatbots like ChatGPT to make decisions about books to comply with state laws. In an effort to comply with these new laws, several school districts hastily resorted to using AI to make recommendations on certain books to remove from circulation. This is an example of how an intended user - libraries and schools - were using chatbots for a surprising and unintended use case with a wide variety of affected uses (also both intended and unintended).

Students who may have been confident and engaged in earlier lessons may find themselves deflated by the task of writing about their chatbots and describing their decisions. It can be helpful to acknowledge this change in dynamic, but encourage students to lean into it rather than away from it. Taking time to document and describe our chatbots and other digital artifacts is a core part of any new technology, and might take a different set of skills but is just as important. Be sure to provide writing supports to students who may need it, such as having students explain it to you first before writing it down."

Consider having students reflect more deeply on the impacts of chatbots designed to befriend individuals, and consider having them find news articles of the intended and unintended consequences of such chatbots. Students could reflect on the articles they find and discuss how guardrails or restrictions may be necessary components of chatbots like this, or what the companies could have done to avoid these types of situations (for example, making the AI assistants mimic human behavior but still clearly identify itself as an AI agents similar to Alexa or Siri)."

Here's the big picture behind this activity:\n- Students are [participating in a **collaborative game**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqtfMZyn-UekUoVFgYCHyVqOa7StNY9-wl-FlLOaZqk/edit#heading=h.59k2gm16lgj2), where each person takes on a specific role or persona and they all have to work together to \"win\" against the scenario set out by the game. This is similar in spirit to board games like [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) or [Forbidden Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Island_(game))\n- Students will be in groups of 4, where all four people have taken on a persona [related to a specific scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9P0FYWMBDQguWedAGi541P-HYbRS1gbcjFbFxdpRSk/edit). Their goal will be to work together to come up with guidelines for Generative AI that try to satisfy the needs and goals of everyone in the group. \n  - For example: an actor, a producer, an audience member, and a costume designer must work together to come up with guidelines for use of Generative AI in movie productions.\n- Each student has a particular persona they can embody on a [Character Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0C1Tp1JhpnJNFjzlxI-bJpisZmZZe6uyglW0JgNm7s/edit). These cards include some baseline information about how this person might feel about generative AI, along with some news articles that students read and react to _as this character_.\n\n\nEven though the ultimate goal is to be in a group as a character solving a problem, the lesson plan introduces these steps in stages rather than explaining the full game all-at-once. First students are introduced to their character and read their news articles. Once they understand their character, then they form their groups and are given their scenario. And once they understand their scenario, they can begin the collaborative game of coming up with guidelines for generative AI."
