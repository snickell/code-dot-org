Why might that data be important?*\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Students should be able to look around the classroom and name several objects (desk, books, etc.) or traits and preferences of classmates (long or short hair, favorite colors, etc.) and share. Remind students that data is organized information. To get the conversation started, you might suggest a few examples, such as counting the total number of books on different rows of shelves, the frequency of certain titles, number of people with long, medium, or short hair.  In addition to being able to just name things that we might collect data about – number of books, height of desks, etc. – push students to also answer why such data might be important and how it could be used. For example, the frequency of certain titles might give insight into what grade level is primarily taught in the classroom.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Place students in pairs.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Have students take out a scrap piece of paper.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Have students work with their partner to collect and write down their data as quickly as possible (about 3-4 minutes).

Sample responses could include:\n* The average desk height in the classroom is 28” which is below the recommended height of 29” - 30” for a high school classroom\n* Books that are about math tend to be colored blue more than any other color – maybe people associate blue with calculation and logic?\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discuss:** *How might the data you collected be used to make improvements or changes in our classroom?*\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Discussion Goal:** Students should be able to make the connection between gathering of data and its potential real-world impacts. This can underscore how data is often used to drive decisions. \nSample responses could include:\n* The ratio of short hair vs. longer hair is 3 to 1. This might indicate that summer is coming and it’s getting warmer outside, or it might indicate that the current fashion trends are for shorter styles for both men and women.\n* I feel as though our desks are too short, and I feel as though I am hunching over all of the time. Now, with this data that indicates that the height is below average, I can make an argument to the school board that we should invest in desks that are ergonomically designed for high school students so that they will be able to perform better.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Introduce the learning objectives.\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> **Do This:** Introduce the Question of the Day."

Invest.\n* More money moves from mobile phones in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere in the world.

Steer the discussion and student wonderings to focus on the following:\n\n* Outliers:\n   * **Pumpkin Pie in November:** The sharp increase in pumpkin pie consumption in November is an outlier. This suggests that pumpkin pie is highly favored during Thanksgiving and should be a priority dessert for November school events.\n   * **Low Dessert Consumption in January:** There is a noticeable drop in all dessert types in January, likely due to a post-holiday decrease in interest or health-driven New Year resolutions. This could imply that January school parties might focus less on desserts or offer healthier dessert options.\n\n* Patterns:\n   * **Summer Preference for Ice Cream:** Ice cream shows increased consumption during the summer months (June, July, August). This indicates a preference for cooler, refreshing desserts during warmer weather, making it an ideal choice for end-of-year or summer-related school celebrations.\n   * **General Popularity of Cookies and Cupcakes:** Cookies and cupcakes maintain a relatively consistent popularity through most of the year, suggesting they are reliably favored choices that could regularly feature in school parties.\n\n* Trends:\n   * **Rising Cookie Consumption in Spring and Summer:** There is an upward trend in cookie consumption from March to July, peaking in July. This could indicate a growing preference for cookies during this period, possibly due to their convenience at events or their appeal to a broad range of students.\n\n* Insights:\n   * **Seasonal Preferences:** Different desserts are favored at different times of the year. Tailoring dessert offerings to seasonal preferences could enhance student enjoyment and participation in school parties.\n   * **Event-driven Choices:** Certain desserts like pumpkin pie are extremely popular during specific months, likely due to cultural events such as Thanksgiving. Aligning dessert offerings with cultural or seasonal events can make school events feel more festive and relevant.\n\nStudents might also notice or wonder about the Shape of Distribution or Measures of Center. While these concepts are not the focus of today’s lesson, it is important to recognize and highlight any references to these concepts, even if not explicitly names, linking them back to the previous lesson. If you have time, it might be helpful to specifically ask students about the Shape of Distribution and Measures of Center in order to reinforce what they learned the previous lesson.",

They should also be able to suggest responsible practices that mitigate these risks, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to ethical considerations in data science. If students are struggling to think of additional concerns, here are some example responses you could use with students to help them get started:\n* In today's lesson, when we created histograms, I realized how choosing different bin sizes could change how the data looked. This made me think about accuracy and how important it is to represent data truthfully without manipulating the viewer’s perception.\n* You mentioned privacy concerns with mapping data. In our exercise, we didn't use personal data, but it made me think about how companies might use similar techniques with personal data. We should always ensure data anonymization before creating such visualizations to protect individual identities.\n* You mentioned misuse of data. When we use powerful tools like CODAP to analyze data, it's crucial to think about the consequences of our analysis. For instance, if we're identifying trends that might influence decision-making in businesses or government, we need to be extra cautious about confirming our findings."
