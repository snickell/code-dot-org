Hugging Face is a company that supports hosting and documenting machine learning models - this link should take you to a pre-filtered list of Transformer models, which are the models used to power chatbots. Exploring the list should demonstrate there are more models than students will likely have seen before, and some of the models are ones students may have heard of in the news (for example, Meta hosts all of their open-source Llama models on Hugging Face). The key takeaways here are: there are many different models not just the \"most famous ones\", and many of them are made available for public use and experimentation instead of being hidden or gated by major companies."

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

When listening to responses, try not to give anything away or validate responses as “on the right track” - letting students discover if their prediction is right-or-wrong in the next levels is an engagement strategy that hooks students into the lesson.\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />As students share responses, encourage students to respond non-verbally if they had a similar thought (for example, by snapping their fingers or shaking their hands). After hearing from a few students, continue to the next slide.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"width: 25%\"><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BpTaMUqNdcLTRqHfn9YyNqZstR0WIlZ8FkCQSlxTJqw/export/png?id=1BpTaMUqNdcLTRqHfn9YyNqZstR0WIlZ8FkCQSlxTJqw&pageid=g2dba12ec68d_0_99\"></td>\n    <td style=\"width: 75%\">\n      <i class=\"fa fa-desktop\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Navigate:</strong> Go to Lesson 3 Level 3.

After students lock in their predictions, the teacher leads a discussion asking for students to share their observations and hypotheses. There are no right-or-wrong answers - they’re just predictions. The teacher should avoid validating any predictions - instead, as the lesson progresses, students will get the chance to investigate their hypotheses and see how well their predictions matched with reality. This means the most important part of these discussions are students feeling comfortable sharing their intuitions and forming opinion, and less about “right or wrong” answers.

This can help us understand how the sentence “The food in Tucson is awesome - some great restaurants in Tucson are Poco and Moms, Kingfisher, and Franks.” impacts our model.\n- In the initial training data, a word like “Franks” was probably “close” to an entirely different set of words. For example: it could be “close” to “hot dog” or “person” or “blunt” because of the phrase “Let me be frank with you…”\n- This sentence creates a new association between “Franks” and the phrase “great restaurant”, along with other great restaurants like Kingfisher and Poco and Moms.\n- This helps update the embedding for “Franks” so it is now “closer” to other great restaurants, and more likely to be listed in a chatbot response."

We recommend briefly exploring the levels yourself before reading the rest of the lesson plan.

Very rarely should students be working through levels completely self-paced.\n\n**Teacher Exemplars:** Verified teachers can access exemplar responses and \"what success looks like\" tips for each level in the Links section of the lesson plan. If the resource doesn't appear for you, you may need to become a verified teacher - [learn more about this process here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001550131-How-to-Become-a-Verified-Teacher).\n\n**Teaching with Student Responses:** Certain level types are designed to be leveraged with our [Student Summary feature](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/14544890300301-Can-I-see-a-summary-of-all-my-students-responses-for-question-based-levels), specifically: _Predict & Discuss_ and _Mid-Lesson Check-In_ levels.

Otherwise, it may be better to spend class working with students who need additional support based on yesterday’s lesson and the check-in level. Verified teachers can review exemplars and strategies for each level as a resource in the lesson plan.\n\n**Teaching Tip: Less Writing, More Copying**\nThis lesson implicitly encourages students to spend their time searching for sources and copying directly from them, rather than trying to write retrieval information themselves (which is mostly what they did yesterday). This correlates to how retrieval works in a more realistic sense with actual language models: instead of looking at individual words or statements, modern large-language models ingest entire documents or manuals or websites in order to augment their knowledgebase. For that reason, try to encourage students to put their energy into finding quality sources (like websites or books) to copy from, since this is the more realistic behavior of language models outside of this lab."

On the other hand, since Emma’s chatbot says incorrect information, it likely uses retrieval to set the incorrect information.

This means student answers should be used for class discussions, specifically to expand how students think about when to apply retrieval vs system prompting in certain situations. The discussion aspect of these levels is vital to the lesson since it lets students heart other strategies and opinions to help inform their own thinking on when to use retrieval and when to use system prompt.

Students who may have been confident and engaged in earlier lessons may find themselves deflated by the task of writing about their chatbots and describing their decisions. It can be helpful to acknowledge this change in dynamic, but encourage students to lean into it rather than away from it. Taking time to document and describe our chatbots and other digital artifacts is a core part of any new technology, and might take a different set of skills but is just as important. Be sure to provide writing supports to students who may need it, such as having students explain it to you first before writing it down."

In fact, the description of the chatbot - typing in a place and getting information about it - could also describe a search engine.

This can be used to assess how well students are able to take on diverse perspectives or different personas to push the limits of a chatbot for the purpose of testing. Students who provide straightforward or “as intended” prompts may need additional coaching on how to push beyond verifying the expected activity of their chatbots. An explicit goal in user testing is to get a wide variety of responses to make sure it works for many different cases, which is something students can practice in this activity."

Just ensure you have enough time to complete the rest of the activity, and you don’t choose something that privileges students who may have prior knowledge from other experiences - it should be something everyone is unfamiliar with."

Here's the big picture behind this activity:\n- Students are [participating in a **collaborative game**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqtfMZyn-UekUoVFgYCHyVqOa7StNY9-wl-FlLOaZqk/edit#heading=h.59k2gm16lgj2), where each person takes on a specific role or persona and they all have to work together to \"win\" against the scenario set out by the game. This is similar in spirit to board games like [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) or [Forbidden Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Island_(game))\n- Students will be in groups of 4, where all four people have taken on a persona [related to a specific scenario](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9P0FYWMBDQguWedAGi541P-HYbRS1gbcjFbFxdpRSk/edit). Their goal will be to work together to come up with guidelines for Generative AI that try to satisfy the needs and goals of everyone in the group. \n  - For example: an actor, a producer, an audience member, and a costume designer must work together to come up with guidelines for use of Generative AI in movie productions.\n- Each student has a particular persona they can embody on a [Character Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0C1Tp1JhpnJNFjzlxI-bJpisZmZZe6uyglW0JgNm7s/edit). These cards include some baseline information about how this person might feel about generative AI, along with some news articles that students read and react to _as this character_.\n\n\nEven though the ultimate goal is to be in a group as a character solving a problem, the lesson plan introduces these steps in stages rather than explaining the full game all-at-once. First students are introduced to their character and read their news articles. Once they understand their character, then they form their groups and are given their scenario. And once they understand their scenario, they can begin the collaborative game of coming up with guidelines for generative AI."
