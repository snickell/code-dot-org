## Scenario Introduction

##### You are designing an algorithm to prioritize emergency response resources (e.g., ambulances or firefighters) when there are multiple incidents at the same time.

## Background Information:

- Resources are limited, and not all emergencies can be addressed simultaneously.
- Some incidents may require immediate attention (e.g., life-threatening situations).
