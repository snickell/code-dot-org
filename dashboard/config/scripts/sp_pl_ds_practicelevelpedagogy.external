# Practice Levels

#### Practice levels are the final levels in most lessons. They let students apply lesson knowledge and develop fluency in new concepts and syntax. 

#### The difficulty of the levels progress, meaning, level A is the easiest to complete, while C or D will be more challenging. 

#### Students can choose which levels to complete and don't need to finish all before moving on.

#### Here is an example:

## Facilitation Strategies 

- #### **Embrace Student Choice:** Let students choose practice levels based on their interests and comfort to boost engagement.
- #### **Student Explanations:** Provide opportunities for students to present and explain their solutions, fostering leadership and deeper understanding.
- #### **Embrace Mistakes:** Use a "Mistake Counter" to normalize errors and celebrate debugging as part of learning.
- #### **Resources:** Encourage using Help & Tips, Documentation tabs, or printed materials like a Word Wall for reference.
