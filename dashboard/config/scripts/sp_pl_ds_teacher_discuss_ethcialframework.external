# Discussing Cleaning Data  

## Discuss and Compare

#### A key idea in Data Science is that information can be represented in a variety of ways; data scientists have to make choices, and these choices have trade-offs.

#### When students compare their work, they have an opportunity to both communicate the choices they made and to see the choices made by another student. 

> #### **Classroom Scenario:** 
> - #### **Student A** cleaned the data by excluding records with blank fields, but didn't consider including a column for dietary restrictions, like vegetarian or vegan options, which was in the original survey data.
> - #### **Student B** also cleaned the data, but specifically preserved the dietary restriction information, categorizing students as "vegetarian," "vegan," or "no restrictions." 


## Consider the Ethical Framework 

#### **Discuss:** Which do you think should be prioritized when deciding how to clean data?

#### For **Accuracy and Bias**, students may bring up things like:

- #### Changing the format allows the data scientist's bias to enter the picture
- #### Cleaned data may not accurately portray what the person wanted
- #### Cleaned Data helps form a more accurate picture -- someone who misspelled pepperoni still wants pepperoni pizza

#### For **Privacy**, students may bring up things like:

- #### Creating categories can unintentionally identify certain members of a group

#### For **Misuse and Consent**, students may bring up things like:

- #### Itâ€™s possible that people have not consented to their data being used in this altered, cleaned, format
