It describes an aspiration for how you might think, feel, engage with others, or engage in your learning so that you can be your best self today. When you set an intention, you’re likely to make choices that support it—in what you do or think. You might forget all about your intention today, but some little part of your mind remembers it."</i>

* #### I would like to engage with expanding access to brainstorm strategies to recruit more students to my computer science classroom.
* #### I would like to learn more about unconscious bias to make my classroom a welcoming place for all students.
