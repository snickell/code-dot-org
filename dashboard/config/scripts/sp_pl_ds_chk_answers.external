##Scenario 1:
#### An app uses past user behavior to recommend new music playlists tailored to individual tastes.
#### **Answer: Data Science-** *Because the app uses past data and algorithms to understand preferences and recommend music, itâ€™s an example of data science in action.*

## Scenario 2:
#### A teacher grades students' essays manually based on a rubric without any software assistance.
#### **Answer: Not Data Science-** *Since the teacher is grading manually without using data or algorithms, this does not involve data science.*



## Scenario 3:
#### A company analyzes customer purchase history to forecast future product demand and optimize inventory.
#### **Answer: Data Science-** *The company is using data to predict demand and make decisions, which is a core part of data science.*

## Scenario 4:
#### A photographer manually edits photos in Photoshop to enhance their quality.
#### **Answer: Not Data Science-** *Editing photos by hand does not involve data analysis or algorithms, so it is not data science.*

##Scenario 5:
####A social media platform analyzes user interactions to identify trending topics and suggest relevant content.
