## Curriculum Alternatives

#### Mainstream block- and text-based coding are often not accessible for students with disabilities. Code.org works hard to ensure our curriculum is accessible, but we also recognize the wealth of alternative curricula that may better suit the needs of your students.

#### Check out the following curricula:

* #### (K-8) <a href="https://milnel2.github.io/blocks4alliOS/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blocks4All</a> - A block-based programming environment for iPad that teaches basic programming concepts using the Dash robot. Accessible with VoiceOver, Switch Control, and Voice Control.
* #### (9-12) <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/lessons/code.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Version of CSP that uses Quorum</a>, a programming language for the blind and visually impaired
* #### (K-12) <a href="https://www.deafkidscode.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeafKidsCode</a> - Promotes computer science and technology education to empower students who are deaf or hard of hearing
