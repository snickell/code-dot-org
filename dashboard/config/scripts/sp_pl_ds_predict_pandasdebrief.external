## Prediction Discussion

#### While you may not fully understand the code yet, having two tabs, or **two files**, stands out. One file is a list of data separated by commas and the other was the main code. 

#### Here is the main code:

### ðŸ”Ž **You may have noticed:** 

- ####  The code imports pandas and reads *gas_prices.csv* into a variable named *data*.
- ####  **'print(gas_data.shape)'** outputs two number - maybe the number of rows and columns.

### ðŸ’¡ **You might wonder:**
- ####  Why pandas is shortened to *pd*? 
- ####  What other functions are in panda?

--- 
#### *Remember, at this stage, the aim isn't for students to master these concepts yet, but rather to encourage them to analyze and discuss the code.*

## Let's continue to a *Modify* level.
