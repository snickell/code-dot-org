Like many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, computer science has long been associated with a specific stereotype of a person. Look at the representations of IT professionals and software engineers. What do you notice?\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; margin-top: 20px;\">\r\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; width: 31%;\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://images.code.org/67c25e86abb4783667749b17d4bfb4fa-image-1734386913618.08.31 PM.png\" alt=\"The characters of Silicon Valley sit around a computer.\" style=\"width: 300px; border-radius: 10px;\">\r\n    <p style=\"font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px;\"><i>Silicon Valley</i></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div style=\"text-align: center; width: 28%;\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://images.code.org/4bf20cb32f8f2abc911f8e12be5083e7-image-1734386864304.07.42 PM.png\" alt=\"Three characters from the IT Crowd sit on a couch and look at the camera.

This effect has been observed and measured by researchers who created the <a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED586813\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Draw-A-Computer-Scientist Test</a> (Hansen, et al. 2016). This test is based on the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730670213\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Draw-A-Scientist Test </a>, developed by David Wade Chambers (1983) to observe how children absorb and reproduce stereotypes of scientists.\r\n\r\n#### The following block of text contains several excerpts from Hansen, et al.'s research, who prompted fourth through sixth graders to draw a computer scientist completing work before and after 12 hours of programming instruction by their classroom teacher:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #C6E3E7; border-radius: 40px; color: #000000; width: 95%; padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px; margin: 30px 0px 30px 0px\"> <p style=\"line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px;\">\r\n\r\n<i> \r\n\r\n#### On the pre-assessment, 71% of students drew a male computer scientist, while only 27% drew a female computer scientist. The remaining 3% of student drawings were not coded for gender because the images were unclear (e.g., stick figure drawings and no gender-specific pronoun in the written description.)\r\n\r\n#### 90% of students drew computer scientists working alone, in isolation. In one extreme example, a student drew a computer scientist working in an empty computer lab, and wrote, “She is the only one working.” In contrast, only 10% of students drew more than one computer scientist working together.\r\n\r\n#### After students completed roughly 12 hours of programming instruction within a block-based environment, they were asked to repeat the same activity: draw a computer science working, and describe what is going on in the picture. Note that the curriculum did not address explicitly who could be a computer scientist or stereotypes.\r\n\r\n#### After the computer science instruction, the percentage of drawings featuring a male computer scientist dropped from 71% to 51%, whereas the number featuring females increased from 27% to 31%. One possible explanation for this could be related to the gender of the teacher; a female teacher taught all participating students computer science. \r\n\r\n#### For some of these drawings, only a computer screen was visible; in others, non gender-specific pronouns were used in the written description, and, thus, were not coded for gender. Seven percent of students changed from an initial drawing with a male to a drawing with a female; all of these students were female. <b>Considering that computer science is a male-dominated profession, this is a promising finding because it indicates that computer science experiences in school can change student perceptions about the field, allowing students to more readily see themselves as computer scientists.</b>\r\n\r\n</i>\r\n</p></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin: 0px 0; padding: 10px; width: fit-content;\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://images.code.org/dc8b491549189dd503cab5bc1c81c3de-image-1734389994350.59.51 PM.png\" alt=\"Two hand-drawn images side-by-side by a child of computer scientists sitting at a desk.\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: 300px\">\r\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 10px; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\">Pre- and post-assessment depictions of computer scientists by the same student.
