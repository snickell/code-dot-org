Students learn to code melodies, loops, and interactive compositions in a fun, engaging way while meeting accessibility standards.\r\n\r\n## Who is Music Lab for? \r\n#### Music Lab is designed for students with diverse interests and abilities, including those who may not connect with traditional programming activities. Itâ€™s ideal for teachers seeking flexible, inclusive resources to introduce computer science in an engaging, creative format.\r\n\r\n## Why Teach Music Lab? \r\n* #### Engaging Intro Course: Teaches sequencing, loops, and programming through music, making coding fun and creative.\r\n* ####  Accessible for All: Designed for students with sight disabilities, offering better usability than Sprite Lab or maze puzzles.\r\n* ####  Modular and Flexible: Only a 3-lesson commitment and pairs well with modules like game design, AI/Data, or CSC topics.\r\n* #### Teacher-Friendly: Built for educators new to CS or music, with no prior experience required. Music teachers can explore tangents if desired.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
