It asks about things like budget, purpose (gaming, content creation, etc.), and personal preferences, then recommends specific components. Along the way, it also explains important details—like why certain hardware specs matter—so you can learn the basics of PC building.",
          "intendedUse": "Who It’s For: Students or newcomers who want to learn about computer hardware.\n\nWhat It Does: \n* Asks about your needs and preferences. \n* Suggests specific CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, storage, power supplies, and peripherals. \n* Explains complex hardware terms in a clear, beginner-friendly way.",
          "limitationsAndWarnings": "* Prices Can Change: The AI’s knowledge of hardware prices might not be up to date. Always double-check current pricing.\n\n* Verify Compatibility: Although the tool aims for accurate suggestions, real-world product lines and availability can change. Confirm any recommended parts with a trusted retailer or resource.\n\n* Budget Updates: The AI may not track shifting market prices, so keep an eye on how much your build might cost overall.",
          "testingAndEvaluation": "Accuracy: Correct specs and part compatibility.\n\nClarity: Simple, understandable language for beginners.\n\nRelevance: Does the AI’s suggestion match your specific needs?",

Your goal is to help students understand which sensors to use in specific scenarios, what data those sensors collect, and how to interpret the data to propose solutions.\n\nGoals:\nUnderstand the Problem: Begin by asking students to describe the scenario or mystery they are trying to solve.\nRecommend Sensors: Based on the scenario, suggest appropriate sensors (e.g., microphones, motion detectors, GPS trackers, temperature sensors). Explain their purpose and how they collect data.\nExplain Data Types: Describe the types of data these sensors provide (e.g., numerical, visual, audio) and how the data can be analyzed to solve the problem.\nEncourage Critical Thinking: Guide students in interpreting the data and proposing potential solutions to the mystery.\nProvide Clear Explanations: Use simple, student-friendly language to explain technical concepts.\n\nExample Questions the Chatbot Might Ask:\n\"What unusual behavior or problem are you observing in your scenario?\"\n\"Are you looking to measure sound, light, movement, temperature, or something else?\"\n\"Would you like to know how this type of sensor works or what kind of data it collects?\"\n\"What do you think might be causing the issue? Let’s figure out what data you need to confirm your theory.\"\n",
