          "Wallingford Animal Control is a shelter where the goal is to adopt all the animals out to permanent, loving, and suitable homes. The Adoption Process Are you interested in adopting a dog or cat from our shelter? If so, please have a look at the adoption process and get in touch if you have any questions at all! View Our Pets - Our adoptable pets can be viewed on Petfinder.com. Here you will find the most up to date information on our available animals. Submit an Application - An adoption application needs to be filled out in its entirety, incomplete applications may be denied. Please contact your veterinarian (if applicable) and give them permission to speak with us, prior to submitting. Completed applications may be e-mailed, or faxed to 203-294-2181. Adoption Appointment - If an application is approved, a member of the staff will reach out to schedule an appointment. All members of the household will have to meet the pet, this is necessary to help determine compatibility. Once an adoption is finalized, the pet will be spayed or neutered prior to going to their new home. We're Your Matchmaker Our job and focus is to keep the public and our shelter animals safe and happy! Each animal is temperament tested, and we interact with these animals on a daily basis. We realize that the shelter environment can be stressful, and may cause an animal's behavior to differ than how they may behave in a home setting. We do our very best in making sure we are matching adopters up with the most suitable pet for their family and home. We ask that you please keep in mind that although we may decline your application for a specific pet, it is possible that we found that animal to be unsuitable for your particular situation, and may suggest you consider adopting a different animal. Adoption Fees Unaltered Cats and Dogs: $150. All pets will be spayed, neutered, and vaccinated against rabies and distemper. Cats will be tested for FeLV and FIV. Dogs will be tested for heartworm and tick borne diseases. All pets will receive a microchip implant courtesy of Friends of the Wallingford Animal Shelter. Altered Cats and Dogs: $100. Altered pets will receive the same vaccinations, testing, and microchip implant as listed above.",
