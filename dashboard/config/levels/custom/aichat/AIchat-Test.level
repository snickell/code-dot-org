          "Variables in Python:\nx = 5\ny = \"Hello, World!\"\n\nPython has no command for declaring a variable.\nVariables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.\nIf you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.\nExample\nx = str(3)    # x will be '3'\ny = int(3)    # y will be 3\nz = float(3)  # z will be 3.0 \nVariable names are case-sensitive.\nA variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:\n\n    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n    A variable name cannot start with a number\n    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n    Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\n    A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.\n\nPython allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:\nExample\nx, y, z = \"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\nprint(z)\n\nAnd you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:\nExample\nx = y = z = \"Orange\"\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\nprint(z)\n\nIf you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.\n\nExample\n\nUnpack a list:\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nx, y, z = fruits\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\nprint(z)\n\nVariables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables.\nGlobal variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.\n\nPython has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:\nText Type: \tstr\nNumeric Types: \tint, float, complex\nSequence Types: \tlist, tuple, range\nMapping Type: \tdict\nSet Types: \tset, frozenset\nBoolean Type: \tbool\nBinary Types: \tbytes, bytearray, memoryview\nNone Type: \tNoneType\n\nPython does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:\nExample\n\nImport the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:\nimport random\nprint(random.randrange(1, 10)) "
