  on the page (defaults to 'div')

 * A React component that makes its children draggable using the `useDraggable` hook. Should wrap around a FileBrowserRow.
 * If you -don't- want a row to be draggable, but still want a wrapper, you can wrap it in NotDraggable, below.
 *
 * @param props - The props for the `Draggable` component.
 * @param props.children - The content to be made draggable.
 * @param props.data - An object containing data associated with the draggable element. data must be of type DragDataType.
 * @param props.Component - (Optional) The underlying HTML element to use as the draggable container.
 *                         - Defaults to `'div'`.
