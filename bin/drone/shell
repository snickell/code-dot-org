USAGE="
SSH-es you into a live drone build, for interactive debugging.

Usage: bin/drone/shell ec2-34-201-165-204.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Notes:
  1. Hostname is printed by the 'bin/drone/shell' step of the drone build.
  2. Run only when drone is in either the unit->\`unit-tests\` or ui->\`ui-tests\` step,
     depending on which you want to debug. Running too early will not work.
  3. You must have configured an ~/.ssh/config Host entry for gateway.code.org, and it
     must have gateway as an alias.
